# 📔 My Diary-Themed To-Do List Web App
A soft, elegant, and interactive daily planner — this web app lets you manage your tasks with a calming diary-style design, animations, and checkmarks that actually make productivity feel good.
Built with love using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, this project was made to enhance my portfolio and showcase my ability to blend function with aesthetic.

## 🌟 Features
* ✅ **Checkable Tasks**: Strike through tasks and get a green checkmark when they’re done.
* 🎉 **Confetti Pop-Up**: Finish all your tasks for the day? Enjoy a congratulatory animation!
* 📅 **Diary Feel**: Clean, lined-paper-inspired background and handwritten fonts for a cozy vibe.
* 💾 **Persistent Data**: Tasks are saved using `localStorage`, so nothing disappears on refresh.
* 🚫 **Bulk Delete**: Want a fresh start? A themed confirmation lets you clear all tasks with one click.

## 💡 Why I Built This
I wanted to go beyond just functionality. This app was an opportunity to:
* Practice DOM manipulation and localStorage in JavaScript
* Learn to use visual feedback and animation for user satisfaction
* Design something visually distinct and personalized
